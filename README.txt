== DESCRIPTION:

Flay analyzes code for structural similarities. Differences in literal
values, variable, class, method names, whitespace, programming style,
braces vs do/end, etc are all ignored. Making this totally rad.

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* Reports differences at any level of code.
* Adds a score multiplier to identical nodes.
* Differences in literal values, variable, class, and method names are ignored.
* Differences in whitespace, programming style, braces vs do/end, etc are ignored.
* Works across files.
  * Add the flay-persistent plugin to work across large/many projects.
* Run --diff to see an N-way diff of the code.
* Provides conservative (default) and --liberal pruning options.
* Provides --fuzzy duplication detection.
* Language independent: Plugin system allows other languages to be flayed.
  * Ships with .rb and .erb.
  * javascript and others will be available separately.
* Includes FlayTask for Rakefiles.
* Totally rad.

== KNOWN EXTENSIONS:

* flay-actionpack  :: Use Rails ERB handler.
* flay-haml        :: Flay your HAML source.
* flay-persistence :: Persist results across runs. Great for multi-project analysis.

== TODO:

* Editor integration (emacs, textmate, other contributions welcome).
